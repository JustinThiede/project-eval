# project-eval

Evaluate tickets of a project and compare the estimated effort with the actual effort. Some ticketing systems do not have diagramming tools. To have a good overview if effort was estiamted correctly and which devs might need to improve speed, diagrams can help a lot. Instead of always having to create diagramms in excel you can just add the data into the form and it will create a bar graph.
